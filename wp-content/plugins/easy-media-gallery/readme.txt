= Images not showing up or Show a spinning icon and never finish loading =

Sometimes you may face problem that your images only show a spinning icon and never finish loading, the issue is clearly that there are javascript conflict with your theme and/or some other plugins or there is the possibility of the use an outdated version of jQuery ( below version 1.8.3 ). Let's find out what causes of this issue:

1. Please try to deactivating all plugins except Easy Media Gallery for a while to see if this resolves the problem. If this works, re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s). If this still does not work please try the second options.
1. Please switch to default Wordpress theme such as **Twenty Twelve** or **Twenty Eleven** for a while and try again.
1. If this still does not work please open thread from support forum [here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-media-gallery "Gallery Forum") or you can contact us [here](https://ghozy.link/mtflo).

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[easy-media med="231,233"]'); ?>`

<strong>Keep in mind:</strong>
